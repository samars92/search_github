# search_github

This reposiotory implements a live search that is built on expressjs, reactjs, typescrip and redis, it used github search APIs to retrieve users or reposotories, this is my first time using these technologies so due to the limited time, some things were left out and they are mentioned below.

<b>How to run project:</b>
* git clone git@github.com:samars92/search_github.git

server:
* cd backend
* npm install
* npm run

client:
* cd backend
* npm install
* npm run

<b>What should be done differently if there was more time:</b>
* Using redux-persist instead of storing data in local storage 
* Adding logging and testing API
* Enhancing Styling and showing more information in the result cards, like adding redirection to each user or repo
* Adding pagination for results, for now it only shows the first page
* Full stability test and testing all possible scenarios
